// Light and dark palettes.
//
// The DOM chrome is themed with CSS custom properties in app.css. The canvas cannot be, because
// it is drawn as SVG with presentation attributes so that screen, SVG export and PNG export are
// the same drawing. Every colour the renderer uses therefore comes from here instead of being
// written inline, and this module is the one place a theme is defined for both runtimes.
//
// Export always uses the light palette. A dark PNG dropped into a Word document or a slide deck
// is almost never what someone wants, so buildExportSvg wraps itself in withLightPalette().
//
// state.js is imported for one thing only - the names the user has given their emphasis colours,
// which are a diagram setting. state.js imports nothing from here, so there is no cycle; keep it
// that way.

/**
 * Dark palette, raised in contrast throughout.
 *
 * The first version carried the light theme's habits across: muted greys for secondary text, and
 * card fills only a few points off the canvas. Both fail on a dark ground. Grey on dark reads as
 * disabled rather than secondary - and secondary text is most of what a card says, the column
 * names, their types and the schema-name subtitle - so every ink here is lifted towards white and
 * the type and subtitle inks in particular are now well clear of the fill behind them. The card
 * fills are lifted off the canvas as well, so a card is a card before its border is read.
 *
 * Mirrored by the custom properties in app.css. The two are kept in step by hand: the canvas is
 * SVG drawn with presentation attributes so that screen and export are the same drawing, and CSS
 * cannot reach it.
