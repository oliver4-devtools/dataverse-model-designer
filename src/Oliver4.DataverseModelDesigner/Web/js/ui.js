/**
 * The "Version 1.7.0" line under a tool name, and how it fills itself in late.
 *
 * The About box and the feature guide both describe behaviour that changes between releases, so a
 * page of either that cannot name the release is a page that cannot be trusted - and app.info is
 * fetched once at boot, where it can fail. `pending`, when given, is a promise for a second try:
 * the line draws at once from whatever is already known and repaints when that try settles, so
 * neither dialog has to wait on a host round trip before it can appear.
