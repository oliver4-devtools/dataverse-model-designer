 * What the command bar gives up as the window narrows, least missed first.
 *
 * One entry per thing that can be shelved, and one entry is what actually leaves - the previous
 * version worked in four coarse stages, and the last of them took all six canvas actions off at
 * once. At the widths people actually use that produced a bar showing "Add existing tables"
 * followed by a band of empty space, with Explore relationships, Auto-layout, Propose new tables,
 * Sticky note, Find path and Cascade all gone when there was room for three of them. Dropping one
 * button at a time fills that space.
 *
 * `menu` is the same entry as it appears in the overflow menu, so the bar and the menu are driven
 * by one table. They used to be a CSS selector list and a separate block of menu items, and when
 * "add-proposed" was renamed to "propose" only one of the two was updated - so the button stayed
 * on the bar *and* appeared in the menu that was meant to replace it.
 *
 * Same reason as lastBarSignature for living up here: layoutCommandBar runs during boot.
